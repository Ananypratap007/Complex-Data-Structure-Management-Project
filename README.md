# Complex Data Structure Management Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Complex Data Structure Management Project! This advanced C++ application showcases the intricate design and utilization of data structures, particularly `std::map` and `std::unordered_map`, for efficient data management.

## Features

This project offers the following features:

1. **Data Structure Mastery:** Harness the power of two highly optimized data structures, `std::map` and `std::unordered_map`, to efficiently store and manage data.

2. **Custom Hash Function:** Employ a custom hash function, `MyHash`, to enhance the performance of the `std::unordered_map`.

3. **File Input:** Read input data and commands from an external file, allowing for seamless integration with various data sources.

4. **Dynamic Operations:** Perform dynamic operations such as insertion (`I`) and deletion (`R`) of elements based on the provided commands.

5. **Execution Timing:** Measure the execution time for each data structure operation with precision using the `std::chrono` library.

6. **Structured Output:** Display the contents of both data structures in a structured and comprehensible manner.
